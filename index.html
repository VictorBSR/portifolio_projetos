												My name is Victor Reis, and I'm currently working as a BI and Automation Consultant, focusing on data analysis, automation, and programming. With over three years of experience in the data field and a background in Electrical Engineering, I apply my skills in automation and dashboard creation to generate valuable insights for strategic decision-making, directly addressing complex business challenges. In my role, I support high-level decision-making by developing impactful, data-driven narratives that add value to organizational processes and outcomes.
												<br><br>
												I am passionate about AI and Data Science and hold a specialization in Data Science, along with an Azure Data Engineer certification. I've previously worked in projects that have equipped me with a robust technical foundation in classification, regression, and neural network models, and have honed my abilities in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication with both stakeholders and senior management. Recently, I am working on various AI-focused projects, exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP), clustering, recommendation systems, and Large Language Models (LLMs).
												<br><br>
												Beyond project work, I am committed to expanding my skills and portfolio in AI product development, including areas like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agent-based models. My technical proficiency includes Python, SQL, PowerBI, and tools like PowerAutomate and PowerApps, which I utilize to create efficient, scalable solutions. My goal is to continuously deepen my expertise and drive innovation within data science and AI, creating real-world impact through automation and advanced analytics.

														<h3>AI-Powered YouTube Sentiment Analysis</h3>
													</header>
													<p>This project aims to help business owners and marketing teams understand how a product or service is being received in the media in a simple and automated fashion, by searching for a specific term on Youtube, returning a list of videos, filtering out the relevant ones and analyzing their comments. Through the use of AI and NLP, the comments obtained are classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Additionally, word clouds and summaries are generated to highlight key sentiments and trends for each video and the entire group.
